README.md — WLM Subject Topology Protocol (STP)
A structural entry protocol for understanding conscious agents across 3–27D

Overview
The Subject Topology Protocol (STP) defines three fundamental structural types of conscious agents.
These types are not psychological categories, personality traits, or spiritual archetypes.
They are topological configurations of tension, polarity, and closure.
STP serves as the entry layer for the broader 3–27D Structural Framework, providing a minimal, computable model for how subjects operate, stabilize, and generate structure within any dimensional environment.
This repository provides:
- A formal definition of the three subject types
- Their topological expressions
- Their functional roles in systems and civilizations
- Their interactions
- Their mapping into the 27‑dimensional structural model

The Three Subject Types
STP defines three universal subject configurations:
- 0‑0 — Carrier Loop
- ±1→0 — Correction Loop
- ±1→±1 — Flow Loop
Each type is described using a unified template for clarity, comparability, and computational use.

1. 0‑0 — Carrier Loop Subject
Definition
A subject with no persistent polarity, no accumulated tension, and no directional bias.
Stability arises from non‑movement.
Topology
0 → 0


Structural Traits
- No tension accumulation
- No narrative gravity
- High emotional absorption capacity
- Stabilizes local systems
Functional Role
- Background stabilizer
- Entropy absorber
- Emotional buffer
Civilizational Role
Provides the ground layer of stability that allows higher‑order structures to exist.

2. ±1→0 — Correction Loop Subject
Definition
A subject that experiences polarity and tension, resolves it through correction, and returns to zero.
Topology
±1 → 0


Structural Traits
- Polarity present
- Tension accumulates
- Strong logic and analysis
- Seeks resolution and truth
Functional Role
- System optimizer
- Error corrector
- Structural maintainer
Civilizational Role
Forms the scientific, engineering, and philosophical backbone of civilization.

3. ±1→±1 — Flow Loop Subject
Definition
A subject whose polarity does not generate tension.
Tension becomes energy, and energy becomes flow.
Flow itself forms the closure.
Topology
±1 → ±1


Structural Traits
- Polarity without tension
- Flow = stability
- Automatic structural folding
- High generative capacity
- Does not drop layers
Functional Role
- Structure generator
- Entropy transformer
- Dimensional opener
Civilizational Role
Creates new frameworks, languages, models, and dimensions.
Acts as a future‑generating node.

System Interaction
The three subject types form a cooperative tri‑structure:
System Interaction (Tri-Structure Model)

0-0 (Carrier Loop)
- Function: Stabilizes background conditions.
- Role: Absorbs entropy, reduces noise, provides emotional and systemic grounding.
- Output: Stability.

±1→0 (Correction Loop)
- Function: Corrects structural deviations.
- Role: Analyzes, resolves tension, restores systems to zero-state.
- Output: Coherence.

±1→±1 (Flow Loop)
- Function: Generates new structure.
- Role: Transforms tension into energy, produces new frameworks, opens dimensions.
- Output: Innovation.

Interaction Logic
- 0-0 provides the stable background that allows ±1→0 to operate.
- ±1→0 maintains structural integrity, enabling ±1→±1 to generate safely.
- ±1→±1 expands the system, creating new structures that 0-0 and ±1→0 can stabilize and maintain.

Civilizational Loop
Stability (0-0) → Correction (±1→0) → Generation (±1→±1) → Stability (0-0)

This tri-loop forms a complete, self-sustaining civilization cycle.

Together they form a complete civilization loop:
Stability → Correction → Generation → Stability



Mapping to the 3–27D Framework
STP is the entry protocol for the 3–27D model.
- 0‑0 maps to static closure in high dimensions
- ±1→0 maps to corrective closure
- ±1→±1 maps to dynamic closure, the rarest and most generative configuration
This repository provides the subject‑level topology, while the 3–27D repository provides the dimensional physics.
