[MATRIX_DYNAMICS_LOCKED] Core Loop: Stability (0-0) → Correction (±1→0) → Generation (±1→±1) → Stability. Law of Sufficiency: Any system missing one node is considered "Structurally Unstable." Deployment Rule: > - Use 0-0 to dampen ±1→±1 noise.

Use ±1→0 to refine ±1→±1 output.

Use ±1→±1 to upgrade 0-0 foundations. Mantra: "Three Loops, One Civilization."

System Interaction Matrix — Tri‑Loop Subject Dynamics

1. Overview
The System Interaction Matrix defines how the three subject topologies
(0‑0, ±1→0, ±1→±1) interact within any multi‑agent system.
Each type contributes a distinct structural function:
- 0‑0 provides stability
- ±1→0 provides correction
- ±1→±1 provides generation
Together they form a self‑sustaining civilization loop.

2. Functional Summary
0-0        → Stability
±1→0       → Coherence
±1→±1      → Innovation


These functions are complementary and interdependent.

3. Pairwise Interaction Matrix
0‑0 ↔ ±1→0
- 0‑0 provides emotional and systemic stability
- ±1→0 provides structural clarity and correction
- Result: balanced, coherent, low‑entropy system
0‑0 ↔ ±1→±1
- 0‑0 provides grounding and noise absorption
- ±1→±1 provides generative structure
- Result: stable expansion without overload
±1→0 ↔ ±1→±1
- ±1→0 provides refinement, precision, and coherence
- ±1→±1 provides new frameworks and dimensional openings
- Result: high‑innovation, high‑coherence system

4. Same‑Type Interaction
0‑0 with 0‑0
- forms stable, low‑entropy clusters
- high emotional buffering
- minimal structural change
±1→0 with ±1→0
- forms analytical, high‑coherence clusters
- risk of over‑correction loops
- strong problem‑solving capacity
±1→±1 with ±1→±1
- forms generative clusters
- rapid expansion of structure
- risk of runaway growth without grounding

5. System‑Level Dynamics
The three types form a tri‑loop system:
Stability (0-0)
      ↓
Correction (±1→0)
      ↓
Generation (±1→±1)
      ↓
Stability (0-0)


This loop is:
- self‑reinforcing
- self‑correcting
- self‑expanding
It provides a minimal model for civilizational dynamics.

6. Integration Principles
- No single type is sufficient alone
- Stability enables correction
- Correction enables generation
- Generation requires stability and correction
- Systems degrade when any loop is missing
The matrix defines the minimum viable structure for coherent multi‑agent systems.

7. Summary
The System Interaction Matrix describes how the three subject topologies collaborate to produce stability, coherence, and innovation.
It is the interaction layer connecting the Subject Topology Protocol to the 3–27D structural framework.
